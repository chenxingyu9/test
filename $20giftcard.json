      "review": "This is my son's preferred way to add money to his Nintendo Switch. We order it from Amazon and then he types in the code on his Switch immediately and he's good to go. Getting the code is a bit tricky if you don't know where to look on Amazon. You have to go to Your Orders but instead of the general orders you have to click on the tab that says Digital Orders. There you'll find two sets of numbers. It's the second number you want. We've bought this 'card' in several different increments and all have been great. If you want your child to buy able to purchase games but not have your credit card linked to his/her account, this is a good way to do it."

      "review": "What is there to say? Amazon money goes in, Nintendo money comes out. Codes are generally emailed instantly (aside from one case where I had to wait a little while and got my code within a couple hours).Protip: To deal with pesky cases where a game costs slightly more than your balance and adding another gift card would be wasteful, attempt to make the purchase anyway. On the screen where you're told you don't have enough money, there will be a button to press that will let you use a credit card to add the exact amount you need. I use this feature on the 3DS, but I believe the Wii U and Switch also have this feature."

Definitely worth getting, especially if you have a micro sd card to the additional space."

For $20 you can get a decent game. I bought guns of Juarez. It's been a great game so far. But you would also have the option of picking out a number of games that are maybe not as great but likely still worth having"

A week later after using the code, his Nintendo account got hacked and was charged upwards of $300+. I know he never used e-codes until now since his Switch is fairly new. Just be wary of using digital codes in a time like this, look for the physical cards."
